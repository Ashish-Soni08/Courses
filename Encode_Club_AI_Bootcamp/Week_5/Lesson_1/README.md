# Lesson 01: Introduction to AI

We learned about the basic concepts of AI, its capabilities and limitations.

## What is AI?

- AI before November 30, 2022
    - First formal mention of AI was in 1956 by John McCarthy. He stated that the AI@50 conference was "to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in princple be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".
    - The initial decades of AI focused on rule-based systems.
        - AI was seen as a way to automate tasks that required human intelligence.
    - By early 2000s, AI applications became more common, especially in digital environments.
        - AI for marketing, customer service, and other digital tasks.
        - AI for search engines, recommendation systems and other digital services.
        - AI for games, simulations, and other digital entertainment.
- On November 20, 2022 -> ChatGPT was launched
- AI now, has entered the age of mass adoption
    - AI is now used to create content, not just to automate tasks
    - AI is now used to (Attempt to) "understand" content, not just preprocess data

## ChatGPT

**Q:** Did someone program the application to understand and generate text for each single word in each single language?
**Ans:** No, the application was trained to "understand" and generate text

**Q:** How to train an application?
**Ans:** Applications are pieces of software that run on a computer
**Q:** How do we train a computer?
**Ans:** Machine learning
"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

**Q:** Does it mean that the computer is "learning"?
**Q:** Does it mean that the computer is "thinking"?
**Q:** Does it mean that the computer is "conscious"?
